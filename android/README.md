# ToDoList
This project is based on https://manijshrestha.wordpress.com/2017/06/03/using-room-with-kotlin/

The original feature set included a DAO which could only add tasks (e.g. checking a box was not persisted).
At the time of this writing, I have added: completion persistence, deletion, editing, and time-based snoozing.

Note that I am not an Android engineer, so be wary of referencing this code for good practices. That also means I'm open to any feedback!
