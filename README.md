# ToDoList
This project is based on https://manijshrestha.wordpress.com/2017/06/03/using-room-with-kotlin/

The original feature set included a DAO which could only add tasks (e.g. checking a box was not persisted).
At the time of this writing, I have added: completion persistence, deletion, editing, and time-based snoozing.
